# Analysis Olink data

## Set-up mouse experiment
There were two conditions: 
- CI+PBS = Carotid Injury + PBS, this is the control 
- CI+S.pn. = Carotid Injury + streptococcus pneumonia, this is the infection group

## Olink panel
The Olink mouse exploratory panel (ww.olink.com/mouse-exploratory) was performed using EDTA plasma from the mice (40 ul samples). This panel includes 96 proteins of which the list can be found in the data folder. All samples passed quality control (QC). However, some of the proteins had values under the limit of detection (LOD). The LOD is defined by Olink as 3 times the standard deviation over background.
